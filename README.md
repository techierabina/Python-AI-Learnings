# ðŸ§  AI Projects in Python  
Welcome to my **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Projects** repository! ðŸš€  
This repository contains various AI implementations in Python, covering topics from search algorithms to machine learning.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository  
As a **Masterâ€™s student studying Data Science**, I am exploring different AI concepts using Python. The projects here are based on **"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig**, focusing on problem-solving with algorithms.

## ðŸ”¥ Projects Included  
âœ… **Search Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, A*)  
âœ… **Adversarial Search** (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning)  
âœ… **Local Search Optimization**  
âœ… **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning**  
âœ… **Belief Networks & Probabilistic Models**  
âœ… **Machine Learning & Neural Networks (Coming Soon!)**
